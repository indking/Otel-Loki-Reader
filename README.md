# Otel-Loki-Reader

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A specialized tool for reading and processing logs from Loki and converting them into Prometheus metrics through OpenTelemetry (OTel).

## üìã Overview

Otel-Loki-Reader connects to a Loki log server, extracts specific metrics from structured logs, and exports them to Prometheus. This enables better monitoring and visualization of log data as time-series metrics, facilitating integration with Grafana dashboards and alerting systems.

The tool is particularly useful for monitoring server and application health by extracting information like:
- Server start/stop events
- Error rates
- Flow execution rates
- Session uptimes
- Server status (Running, Stopped, Error, Unresponsive)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Loki Log Collection**: Connects to Loki to query and extract log entries
- **Metrics Generation**: Converts log data into time-series metrics
- **Prometheus Integration**: Pushes metrics to Prometheus via push gateway
- **Server Status Monitoring**: Tracks server status and detects unresponsive systems
- **Project-level Aggregation**: Consolidates metrics from multiple servers into project-level summaries
- **Containerized Deployment**: Ready for Docker and Kubernetes deployment
- **Configurable**: All parameters can be adjusted via environment variables

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Loki server (for log storage)
- Prometheus server with Push Gateway (for metrics storage)
- Docker/Podman (for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes/MicroK8s (for orchestrated deployment - optional)

## üì¶ Installation

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/indking/Otel-Loki-Reader.git
   cd Otel-Loki-Reader
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the application (copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed)

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python loki_reader.py
   ```

### Docker Installation

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t loki-reader:latest .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name loki-reader --env-file .env loki-reader:latest
   ```

### Podman Installation (Windows)

1. Build using provided script:
   ```bash
   build.bat
   ```

2. The image will be exported to `./exported-images/`

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. Build and export the image:
   - Windows: Use `build.bat`
   - Linux: Use `build.sh`

2. Deploy to Kubernetes:
   - Windows: Use `deploy-k8s.bat`
   - Linux: Use `deploy-k8s.sh`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables, which can be set in the `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Loki_SERVER_HOST | Loki server hostname | loki |
| Loki_SERVER_PORT | Loki server port | 3100 |
| MAX_WORKERS | Number of worker threads | 10 |
| PROMETHEUS_GATEWAY | Prometheus push gateway URL | http://prometheus-prometheus-pushgateway:9091 |
| PROMETHEUS_JOB_NAME | Job name for Prometheus metrics | summary_metrics |
| LOG_LEVEL | Logging level | INFO |
| LOG_DIR | Log directory | logs |
| LOG_MAX_BYTES | Maximum log file size | 10485760 |
| LOG_BACKUP_COUNT | Number of backup log files | 5 |
| ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOG | Enable console logging | true |
| ERROR_TIMEOUT_HOURS | Error status timeout in hours | 1 |
| UNRESPONSIVE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES | Unresponsive status timeout in minutes | 5 |
| RESET_TIMEOUT_HOURS | Reset timeout in hours | 3 |

## üìä Metrics

The following metrics are generated:

| Metric | Description | Labels |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| project_name | Name of the project | serverid, projectkey |
| current_session_start | Session start timestamp | serverid, projectkey |
| latest_transaction_time | Latest transaction timestamp | serverid, projectkey |
| uptime_current_session_ns | Session uptime in nanoseconds | serverid, projectkey |
| uptime_current_session_sec | Session uptime in seconds | serverid, projectkey |
| total_errors_current_session | Total errors in current session | serverid, projectkey |
| errors_last_hour | Error count in last hour | serverid, projectkey |
| total_flows_current_session | Total flow count in session | serverid, projectkey |
| flows_last_hour | Flow count in last hour | serverid, projectkey |
| server_status | Current server status | serverid, projectkey, status |
| project_status | Current project status | projectkey, status |
| server_count | Count of servers | projectkey |

## üíª Usage

The application runs continuously, querying Loki for new logs at regular intervals and pushing metrics to Prometheus.

### Command line

```bash
python loki_reader.py
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name loki-reader --env-file .env loki-reader:latest
```

### Kubernetes

Once deployed with the `deploy-k8s.sh` or `deploy-k8s.bat` script, the application runs as a deployment in the specified namespace.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

The application consists of several key components:

1. **Config**: Manages configuration and sets up logging
2. **MetricsState**: Maintains the current state of metrics and server sessions
3. **LokiLogReader**: Queries Loki for logs and processes the results
4. **Prometheus Integration**: Pushes metrics to the Prometheus push gateway

## üîí Security

- The application uses environment variables for configuration
- No authentication credentials are hardcoded
- Network communication should be secured using HTTPS where applicable

## üß™ Testing

Manual testing can be performed by:

1. Setting up a Loki server with sample logs
2. Setting up a Prometheus server with push gateway
3. Running the application with appropriate configuration
4. Verifying metrics in Prometheus
